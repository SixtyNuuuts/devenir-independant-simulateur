  <!-- A) Run docker-compose up -d database to start your database container
     or docker-compose up -d to start all of them.

  B) If you are using the Symfony Binary, it will detect the new service automatically.
     Run symfony var:export --multiline to see the environment variables the binary is exposing.
     These will override any values you have in your .env files.

  C) Run docker-compose stop will stop all the containers in compose.yaml.
     docker-compose down will stop and destroy the containers. -->
